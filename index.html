### Background and objective

Over the last two decades, a small group of companies gained significant dominance in the new digital markets that emerged with the internet. During this time, in Europe as in other parts of the world, competition authorities have dealt with various cases of abuse of dominance against these platforms. The difficulty of these cases led the European Commission to reflect on the need for a more agile ex-ante regulatory tool to address the competition problems inherent to these activities. Following a complex debate, in November 2022 the Digital Markets Act (DMA) was adopted, becoming one of the first ex-ante regulations on digital markets. It aims to regulate large online platforms, often referred to as “gatekeepers,” that have significant market power and influence over the digital market ecosystem. Gatekeepers are large digital platforms providing so-called core platform services, such as for example online search engines, app stores, or messenger services. The DMA entered into force on 1 November 2022 and became applicable on 2 May 2023.

Since its announcement in December 2020, various organizations including think tanks and academic institutions have conducted research on the economic impact of the DMA, given its significant implications for the digital economy. These studies tend to highlight the DMA's potential to enhance competition and consumer choice, though there are also concerns about possible compliance costs and the impact on innovation dynamics. The specifics of each study can vary, and ongoing research continues to refine our understanding of the DMA's economic impact as its effects become more evident.

The main objective of this workshop is to present state of the art scientific research on several aspects of the economic implications of the DMA, and take stock of the knowledge generated so far. However, as the DMA will go through an evaluation in 2026, the workshop intends to provide timely information to address relevant issues for the coming years of the DMA’s implementation and enforcement. Among others, the questions that will be addressed are: **How can the research generated so far help the DMA evaluation? What research would be needed? What are the DMA areas that generate more and less attention? Which areas require more attention?**
