  <h3>Background and objective</h3>
  <p>
    Over the last two decades, a small group of companies gained significant 
    dominance in the new digital markets that emerged with the internet. During 
    this time, in Europe as in other parts of the world, competition authorities 
    have dealt with various cases of abuse of dominance against these platforms. 
    The difficulty of these cases led the European Commission to reflect on the 
    need for a more agile ex-ante regulatory tool to address the competition 
    problems inherent to these activities. Following a complex debate, in 
    November 2022 the Digital Markets Act (DMA) was adopted, becoming one of 
    the first ex-ante regulations on digital markets. It aims to regulate large 
    online platforms, often referred to as “gatekeepers,” that have significant 
    market power and influence over the digital market ecosystem. Gatekeepers 
    are large digital platforms providing so-called core platform services, such 
    as for example online search engines, app stores, messenger services. The 
    DMA entered into force on 1 November 2022 and became applicable on 2 May 2023.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since its announcement in December 2020, various organizations including 
    think tanks and academic institutions, have conducted research on the 
    economic impact of the DMA given its significant implications for the 
    digital economy. These studies tend to highlight the DMA's potential to 
    enhance competition and consumer choice, though there are also concerns 
    about possible compliance costs and the impact on innovation dynamics. The 
    specifics of each study can vary, and ongoing research continues to refine 
    our understanding of the DMA's economic impact as its effects become more 
    evident.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main objective of this workshop is to present state of the art scientific 
    research on several aspects of the economic implications of the DMA, and take 
    stock of the knowledge generated so far. However, as the DMA will go through 
    an evaluation in 2026, the workshop intends to provide timely information to 
    address relevant issues for the coming years of the DMA’s implementation and 
    enforcement. Among others, the questions that will be addressed are: How can 
    the research generated so far help the DMA evaluation? What research would be 
    needed? What are the DMA areas that generate more and less attention? Which 
    areas require more attention?
